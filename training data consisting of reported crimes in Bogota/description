This file contains the training data consisting of 10,000 IID simulated streams of reported crime data in Bogota, Colombia 
(from the Spatiotemporal Hawkes process followed by thinning according to the district specific reporting rates). 
We use this to train our proposed WGAN-based estimation procedure.
